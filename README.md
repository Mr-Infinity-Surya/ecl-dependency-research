# ecl-dependency-research

The research goal of the ECL dependency project is to track data usage within an ECL program.  More specifically, the result of a usage analysis should make it possible to forward-trace input values (scalar or otherwise) and see if/how they affect any output; and it should be possible to back-trace output values (scalar or otherwise) to see their source(s).

See [project_notes.docx](project_notes.docx) for more information.
